# Particle Filters in Julia

## An Undergraduate Summer Research project

This work was performed by Katie Li, as part of her Undergraduate Summer Research Assistantship,
funded by [NSERC](https://www.nserc.ca). Katie worked
between May and August 2017, and developed this
Jupyter notebook with Julia code implementing both the "classical"
particle filter for non-linear state space models, and also the robust filter proposed by
