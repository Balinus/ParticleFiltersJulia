## Particle Filters in Julia

This work was performed by Katie Li, as part of her Undergraduate Summer Research Assistanship, between May and August 2017. Available here is a Jupyter notebook with Julia code implementing a "classical" particle filter for non-linear state space models, and also the robust filter proposed by

Note that the notebook still needs to be checked. Will do soon.
