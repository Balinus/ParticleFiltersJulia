# Particle Filters in Julia

## An Undergraduate Summer Research project

This work was performed by Katie Li, as part of her Undergraduate Summer Research Assistantship,
funded by [NSERC](https://www.nserc.ca). Katie worked
between May and August 2017, and developed [this
Jupyter notebook](ParticleFilters.ipynb) with Julia code implementing both the "classical"
particle filter for non-linear state space models, and also the robust filter proposed by

> Maiz, C.S., Molanes-López, E.M., Míguez, J. and Djuriü, P.M. (2012). A particle fltering scheme for
> processing time series corrupted by outliers. *IEEE Transactions on
> Signal Processing* **60**(9): 4611-4627.
> DOI: [10.1109/TSP.2012.2200480](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2200480)

Furthermore, Katie also implemented a 2-dimensional extension of
the "classical" particle filter, which can be found
[here](2D+Particle+Filter.ipynb).
